# Virtual Painter

## Overview
Virtual Painter is an interactive Python application that uses **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** to enable users to draw on a digital canvas using hand gestures. The application allows users to choose between multiple colors (Blue, Green, Red, Yellow) and clear the canvas with the click of a button. It's an interesting way to combine computer vision and creative expression.

## Features
- Hand gesture recognition using **MediaPipe Hands**.
- Drawing with different colors: Blue, Green, Red, Yellow.
- Clear canvas functionality.
- Real-time drawing with the webcam feed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Numpy

You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Virtual-Painter.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
